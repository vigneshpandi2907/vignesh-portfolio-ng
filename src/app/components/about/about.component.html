    <p class="text-justify">
      Full-stack developer with hands-on experience in building responsive web
      applications using Angular and developing secure backend services with
      Java Spring Boot. I specialize in delivering scalable and maintainable
      solutions across the full software development lifecycle.
      <br />
      <br />
      I create modern, user-friendly interfaces using Angular, with a focus on
      reusable components, UI consistency, and performance. My skill set
      includes HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and TypeScript, along with responsive
      design and cross-browser compatibility. On the backend, I develop
      efficient RESTful APIs with Spring Boot and implement security using
      Spring Security, JWT, SAML, and OAuth2. I have experience with JPA,
      Hibernate, microservices architecture, JHipster and good knowledge of SQL for
      queries.
      <br />
      <br />
      Iâ€™m proficient in Git for version control and familiar with Agile
      practices like sprint planning, stand-ups, and retrospectives. I
      collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams to ensure smooth
      development, testing, and deployment cycles.
